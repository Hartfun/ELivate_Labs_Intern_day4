This repository presents an end-to-end analysis of supermarket sales data using a combination of data visualization, business intelligence, and data storytelling. The dataset includes information such as customer demographics, purchase behavior, product lines, and sales performance metrics. Using Tableau, detailed dashboards were created to uncover insights across different dimensions such as gender, customer type, branch, and time of day. Key takeaways include the slightly higher gross income from member customers, stronger performance from female buyers, and Yangon standing out as the top-performing city by gross income.

The project also includes a PowerPoint presentation summarizing critical insights and visualizations to facilitate clear communication with stakeholders. Notable findings point to strategic areas such as expanding membership programs, focusing on high-performing time windows, and maintaining balanced product line offerings. This analysis can help retail decision-makers enhance operational strategy, customer targeting, and marketing efforts
